  <p class="main-text fs-5">
    Hey! My name is Jake Espinosa, and I am a full stack software engineer. My
    interests include computer science, web development, exercising, and cats.
    When I am not programming, I can be found spending time with my wonderful
    wife and two cats, or writing articles for my technology blog.
  </p>
  <p class="main-text fs-5">
    Currently, I am a software developer at

      >EXPANSIA Group</a
    >. Prior to that, I worked in cyber security for the federal government. I
    bring extensive experience auditing systems; thus I understand the mind of
    the adversary and program with security in mind.
  </p>
  <p class="main-text fs-5 mb-0 pb-2">
    I hold a Masters degree in Cyber Security and Information Assurance, a
    Bachelors degree in Cyber Operations with an emphasis in Defense and
    Forensics, and an Associates degree in Cyber Security. I am currently
    pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science mostly for fun, but also to
    understand computation on a much deeper level.
